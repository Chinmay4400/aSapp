A smarter way to connect with your loved ones.

aSapp is a desktop based messenger application, providing an easy way to converse with your contacts.
The entire codebase has been uploaded to this gitHub repository for you to download and run on your machines and have fun. :)
You can also run the messenger using only the Jar file but for better and fuller experience, we recommend you use the full codebase.
Note : You should have jdk version 8 or higher installed on your machine to run the messenger.
